              Before you can vote, you need to register. Once you’re registered,
              you can vote in state, local, and federal elections. You may have
              already registered to vote at your naturalization ceremony. If
              you’re not sure, you can check your registration status online or
              visit your local election office. You may have also received a
              voter registration card by mail. If your name or address has
              changed, you will need to update your voter registration. If you
              haven’t registered, don’t wait! You can register to vote any time
              after your naturalization ceremony.

              online registration. Select your state or territory to find out if
              you can register online. Register by mail: You can download and

              Understand your vote at the local and national level State and
              local elections happen throughout the year. At the state level,
              you may be voting for governors, judges, or members of the state
              legislature. Locally, you may be voting for mayors or other local
              officials. The winning candidates make decisions on topics such as
              the budget for public transit and schools in your community. These
              decisions affect your daily life. Every four years, the
              presidential election decides who will be the leader of the United
              States. There are state and local primaries and caucuses that take
              place before the general election to choose presidential nominees.
              The general election decides the candidate. Each state has its own
              process and rules for voting. Congressional elections decide who
              represents you in Congress. Congress has two parts: the U.S. House
              of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Members of the U.S. House
              of Representatives represent districts within a state. They are
              elected every two years. Members of the U.S. Senate represent
              entire states. They serve for six years, but they are not all
              elected at the same time. Some senators and all members of the
              U.S. House of Representatives run for election (or re-election)
              during midterm elections. Midterm elections take place in the
              middle of every president’s four-year term.
